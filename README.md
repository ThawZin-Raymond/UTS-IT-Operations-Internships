## 1. My understanding of Continuous Integration and Continous Dellivery (CI/CD)
---
From what I have learnt through my undergrad degree, Continuous integration (CI) is a coding methodology and software development practice to implement our code every time into the main repository branch. Whenever a team member share their code changes to the base in GitHub, it will trigger continuous integration to rebuild the whole project checking if the code works as it is after each changes. Then it also validates each integration through automated testing to detect errors as quickly as possible. This automation approach helps a team build organized software more rapidly and reduce integration problems. It also benefits by improving code consistency by committing more frequently to enhance team collaboration. Continuous Delivery (CD) is a software development discipline where code changes are automatically qualified for release to selected environments (development, production and testing environment). It ensures the software can be entirely reliable for release and allows developers to verify the software updates through multiple tests before deploying it to the customers. In the software development terms, I understood CI/CD as the automation which enables incremental changes of code from developers’ system to be delivered quickly to production with reliability and efficiency. I have had previous experience with Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/C), from Advanced Software Development building Real Estate Auction Management Software with a group using Azure DevOps. CI is an important element of the DevOps approach to building and releasing software which promotes collaborative, automation and short feedback cycles.
